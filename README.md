# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository showcases my work in optimizing performance metrics, fixing overfitting with data augmentation, comparing regression models, and utilizing transfer learning with ResNet-50 and etc.

## Project 1: Optimizing Performance Metrics

In this project, I focused on optimizing the values of performance metrics for a given model. The goal was to find the best possible combination of hyperparameters to achieve the highest performance.

## Project 2: Data Augmentation to Fix Overfitting

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning models. This project demonstrates how data augmentation techniques can help fix overfitting and improve model generalization.


## Project 3: Comparing Regression Models + Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

This project involves a comprehensive comparison of different regression models. The goal is to identify the best-performing model.


## Project 4: Transfer Learning with ResNet-50

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning. This project showcases how ResNet-50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, can be used for transfer learning to achieve high performance on a custom dataset.
