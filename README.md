## Project 1: Optimizing Performance Metrics

In this project, I focused on optimizing the values of performance metrics for a given model. The goal was to find the best possible combination of hyperparameters to achieve the highest performance.

## Project 2: Data Augmentation to Fix Overfitting

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning models. This project demonstrates how data augmentation techniques can help fix overfitting and improve model generalization.


## Project 3: Comparing Regression Models + Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

This project involves a comprehensive comparison of different regression models. The goal is to identify the best-performing model.


## Project 4: Transfer Learning with ResNet-50

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning. This project showcases how ResNet-50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, can be used for transfer learning to achieve high performance on a custom dataset.
